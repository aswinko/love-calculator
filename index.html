        <!-- <p class="para-1">True love is unconditional. Never a truer word said. As humans and living beings, we are all about emotions. There are so many facets to emotions. There is one emotion which is the strongest in terms of expression and perhaps the most powerful of them all, the expression of love. The feelings are unlimited in love. It is a summation of all emotions put together, be it anger, pain, grief, hate, laughter, patience, you name it. Love encompasses all these emotions and runs through them in terms of different expressions at different times.</p>
        <p class="para-2">Love cannot be defined in any particular term. It is an individualâ€™s perception. It is the basis to form any relationship and looking for someone is a matter of the heart and mind. However, there is that one special person you may meet. Do you know someone you are drawn to, interested in, feel something special for?.</p>
        -->
        <p class="para-3">Here is the Love Calculator that lets you calculate love compatibility and your chances of a successful relationship.</p>
